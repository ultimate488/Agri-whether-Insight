NASA Data Usage Documentation

Integrated Datasets
This project utilizes the following NASA datasets:
- MODIS Land Surface Temperature*: Provides temperature data critical for understanding crop health.
- NASA Soil Moisture Data*: Helps in monitoring soil moisture levels for optimal irrigation practices.

Data Integration
The app fetches data from NASA's APIs to provide users with up-to-date information on environmental conditions. The data is processed and displayed in real-time to assist farmers in making informed decisions.

API Access
To access the datasets, you will need to create a NASA API key. Instructions on how to obtain an API key can be found [here](https://api.nasa.gov/).
